Question,Expected Answer
Let me know the net weight of LRFXC2416*?,The net weight of the refrigerator model LRFXC2416* is 276 lb (125 kg).
Tell me in kg?,The net weight of the refrigerator model LRFXC2416* is 125.2 kilogram.
Max water pressure ?,The max water pressure of the refrigerator model LRFXC2416* is 120.0 psi.
in Kilo pascal ?,The max water pressure of the refrigerator model LRFXC2416* is 827400.0 pascal.
My refrigerator blasted. What is the defined electrical requirements it had ?,"The voltage of the refrigerator model LRFXC2416* is 115 v, 60 hz."
requested ice cubes are not dispensed,"This may be the cause:
Condensation from food with a high water content has frozen inside of the food package
This is the recommended solution:
This is normal for food items with a high water content.

This can be the probable cause:
Food has been left in the freezer for a long period of time
Recommended solution is:
Do not store food items with high water content in the freezer for a long period of time."
water comes out very slowly,"The cause is:
Reverse osmosis filtration system is used
Recommended solutions are as follows:

1.Reverse osmosis filtration systems can reduce the water pressure below the minimum amount and result in icemaker issues. (Refer to the Connecting the Water Line section.)
2.Reverse osmosis filtration systems can reduce the water pressure below the minimum amount and result in icemaker issues. If the problem persists, it may be necessary to contact a plumber.

The cause is:
Low house water supply pressure
These are all the solutions:

1.The water pressure must be between 20 and 120 psi on models without a water filter and between 40 and 120 psi on models with a water filter. If the problem persists, it may be necessary to contact a plumber.
2.The water pressure must be between 20 and 120 psi (138 and 827 kPa) on models without a water filter and between 40 and 120 psi (276 and 827 kPa) on models with a water filter. If the problem persists, it may be necessary to contact a plumber.

This may be the cause:
Water filter has been exhausted
These are all the solutions:

1.When the ice cubes are smaller than normal.
2.Approximately every six months.When the water filter indicator turns on.When the water dispenser output decreases.When the ice cubes are smaller than normal.
3.Approximately every six months.
4.When the water dispenser output decreases.
5.Replacing the water filter is recommended:
6.When the water filter indicator turns on."
