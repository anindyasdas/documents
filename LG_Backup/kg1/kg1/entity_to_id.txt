In-Door Icemaker produces 70-182 cubes in a 24-hour period, depending on freezer compartment temperature, room temperature, number of door openings and other operating conditions. 	 813
a newly installed refrigerator to begin making ice takes about 12 to 24 hours. 	 814
Ice-making stops when the in-door ice bin is full. 	 815
When full, the in-door ice bin holds approximately 6 to 8 ( 12-16 oz. ) 	 816
glasses of ice. 	 817
Foreign substances or frost on the ice-detecting sensor can interrupt ice production. 	 818
