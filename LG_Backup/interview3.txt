Descriptive:
1> What do you mean by Semantic Search? Semantic vs Syntactic search(pattern matching)
2> What is co-reference Resolution? What are the tools you are familiar with? Why do we need co-ref
3> What is Dependency Parsing? What is Constituency Parsing? Any tool chain you are familiar with
4> What are different types of embeddings that can be used for NLP
5> Given a corpus of passages[1000], and a given question, Find out 5 most relevent passages(Code, Pseducode)
6> What is TF-IDF? Could you implement the logic for TF -IDF?
7> What is KG? What are different types of KGs? Why do we need KGs?
8> How can we retreve images of an object given a Natural Language questions
9> What are the stopwords?


ML/DL
1> What is bias-variance trade off?
2> Why should we use softmax (Exp(score1)/sum(Exp(score1) +Exp(score2)) in multiclass classification? Why not simple probability scores (Score1/Sum( score1, score2)
3> What is vanishing gradient problem?
4> When to use cosine-similarity when to use Mean Squere Error?
5> What can we do if our dataset is highly imbalanced againt minority class? What is positive class what is negative class 
in precesion-recall
6> What is ROC? 

Basic Coding
1> Can you explain BFS or DFS algorithm? Can you implement?
2> What is recursion? Fibbonacci implement

Positive:
"The movie was very good"
"I like the movie"
"I enjoyed the film"

Negative:
"The movie was horrible"
"The Movie was awful"
"I did not like the movie"

 

Test: The movie was not good

Test: I did not enjoy the movie

TF-IDF
The boy is playing football.
Football is also know as Soccer in the US.
John plays soccer very well.
Mike enjoy playing both football and cricket.


What would be corresponding probability values for the below scores of two classes if you apply softmax function to it.
Class1 - 7
Class2 - 3

Define a Class test, that has a constructor and a fucntion "compute" to two print sum of two variable. Instantiate a class object
print sum of two variables.

Inherit from the parent class and  to override "compute" fwo find division of two numbers.
